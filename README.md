# code-refactor

In this code I took a lot of it and had to make it usable for overall betterness of the code but also to be able to be read well and easily. Basically i had to refactor an existing webpage to make it accessible and to improve SEO. Doing so helps with any person but specifically people who are disabled and the webpage needs to be read by voice over or other ways and it actually is read to them correctly.
